# CS-598 Deep Learning for Health Care Final Project

As part of our CS-598 Final Project, we are working on implementation of a generative model that leverages the DeepChem framework.  In addition to leveraging the framework to produce a model that results in valid molecules, we are exploring the addition of teacher forcing as part of this repository and to provide results more in line with the original findings from the paper: Automatic Chemical Design Using a Data-Driven Continuous Representation of Molecules
